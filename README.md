[Odorik.cz](https://www.odorik.cz/) telecommunications 
services into your phone.

## History
I've purchased my first Google Android phone in 2013.
I struggled understanding its concept (e.g. when 
the home button is pressed is the application
running in the background or closed)
so I decided to write an application to learn about it.
This is the result.

The app was written in Eclipse IDE in 2013. 
I found the source codes in my backups (2016), 
migrated it to the current Android Studio (IDEA) 
and published on GitHub.
